Rohak will reject any User Submissions in<br>which Rohak believes, in its sole discretion, that any such activities have<br>occurred.  If notified by a user of a submission that allegedly violates<br>any provision of these Terms of Use, Rohak reserves the right to determine, in<br>its sole discretion, if such a violation has occurred, and to remove any such<br>submission from the Services at any time and without notice.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: rgb(8,8,9);background-color: white;font-size: 12pt;font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;\">9.

You further agree that sending or posting<br>unsolicited advertisements or “spam” on or through the Services is expressly<br>prohibited by this Agreement.  In addition to any remedies that we may<br>have at law or in equity, if we determine, in our sole discretion, that you<br>have violated or are likely to violate the foregoing prohibitions or any<br>applicable rules or policies linked to in these Terms of Service, we may take<br>any action we deem necessary to cure or prevent the violation, including<br>without limitation, banning you from using the Services and/or the immediate<br>removal of the related materials from the Services at any time without notice.<br>We will fully cooperate with any law enforcement authorities or court order or<br>subpoena requesting or directing us to disclose the identity of anyone posting<br>such materials.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: rgb(8,8,9);background-color: white;font-size: 12pt;font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;\">10.

DIGITAL MILLENNIUM COPYRIGHT ACT (“DMCA”)<br>NOTICE. In operating the Services, we may act as a “services provider” (as<br>defined by DMCA) and offer services as online provider of materials and links<br>to third party websites. As a result, third party materials that we do not own<br>or control may be transmitted, stored, accessed or otherwise made available<br>using the Services. Rohak has in place certain legally mandated procedures<br>regarding allegations of copyright infringement occurring on the Services. Rohak<br>has adopted a policy that provides for the removal of any content or the<br>potential suspension of any user that is found to have repeatedly infringed on<br>the rights of Rohak or of a third party, or that has otherwise violated any<br>intellectual property laws or regulations, or any of the terms and conditions<br>of this Agreement. If you believe any material available via the Services<br>infringes a copyright, you should notify us using the notice procedure for<br>claimed infringement under the DMCA (17 U.S.C. Sect. 512(c)(2)). We will<br>respond expeditiously to remove or disable access to the material claimed to be<br>infringing and will follow the procedures specified in the DMCA to resolve the<br>claim between the notifying party and the alleged infringer who provided the<br>Content. Our designated agent (i.e., proper party for notice) to whom you<br>should address infringement notices under the DMCA is Rohaklegal@Rohak.co and<br>cc hello@Rohak.co.   </span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: rgb(8,8,9);background-color: white;font-size: 12pt;font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;\">Please provide the following notice:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: rgb(8,8,9);background-color: white;font-size: 12pt;font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;\">Identify<br>     the copyrighted work or other intellectual property that you claim has<br>     been infringed;</span>&nbsp;</li>\n<li><span style=\"color: rgb(8,8,9);background-color: white;font-size: 12pt;font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;\">Identify<br>     the material on the Services that you claim is infringing, with enough<br>     detail so that we may locate it on the Services;</span>&nbsp;</li>\n<li><span style=\"color: rgb(8,8,9);background-color: white;font-size: 12pt;font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;\">A<br>     statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use<br>     is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;</span>&nbsp;</li>\n<li><span style=\"color: rgb(8,8,9);background-color: white;font-size: 12pt;font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;\">A<br>     statement by you declaring under penalty of perjury that (a) the above<br>     information in your notice is accurate, and (b) that you are the owner of<br>     the copyright interest involved or that you are authorized to act on<br>     behalf of that owner;</span>&nbsp;</li>\n<li><span style=\"color: rgb(8,8,9);background-color: white;font-size: 12pt;font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;\">Your<br>     address, telephone number, and email address; and</span>&nbsp;</li>\n<li><span style=\"color: rgb(8,8,9);background-color: white;font-size: 12pt;font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;\">Your<br>     physical or electronic signature.</span>&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"color: rgb(8,8,9);background-color: white;font-size: 12pt;font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;\">We may give notice to our users of any infringement<br>notice by means of a general notice on any of our Services, electronic mail to<br>a user’s email address in our records, or by written communication sent by<br>first-class mail to a user’s physical address in our records.
